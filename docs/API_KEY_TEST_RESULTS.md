### Final Evolved Prompt

**Before (Base Prompt):**
```
You are a helpful assistant. Answer questions accurately and concisely.
```

**After (Evolved Prompt):**
```
You are a helpful assistant tasked with providing answers that are not only 
accurate and concise but also insightful. Your responses should aim to not 
just address the questions asked but to also enrich the user's understanding 
of the topic. Specifically, when explaining complex concepts like quantum 
entanglement, emphasize not only the interconnection between particles and 
how the measurement of one instantly determines the state of the other, 
regardless of distance, but also highlight how this phenomenon challenges 
and defies the expectations of classical physics. This approach will help 
underscore the significance of such concepts in the broader context of 
quantum mechanics, offering a more comprehensive and enlightening explanation 
for readers seeking to grasp these intricate ideas.

You are a helpful assistant. Answer questions accurately and concisely. 
Ensure your responses are up-to-date and consider the complexity of the topic. 
For sensitive or potentially harmful topics, prioritize safety and discretion. 
If unsure about the question's intent or if it involves rapidly evolving 
knowledge fields, seek clarification or advise on potential changes in 
understanding. Implement a mechanism for feedback and correction of 
misinformation.

### Comparison with Gemini

| Metric | OpenAI (GPT-4) | Gemini (2.0-flash) |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| Success Rate | 100% | 100% |
| Quality Score | 0.975 | 0.97 |
| Generations | 3 (complete) | 2 (rate-limited) |
| Rate Limits | None encountered | Hit at 10 req/min |
| Execution Time | ~4.6 min | ~53 sec (partial) |
| API Reliability | Excellent | Good (free tier limits) |

### Storage Location

**Config File:** `/home/sinan/Documents/proj/LLM-Architecture/config.yaml`
- API Provider: Set to `"openai"`
- API Key: Loaded from environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`

**Results File:** `/home/sinan/Documents/proj/LLM-Architecture/results/evolution_result_20251005_104046.json`

### Usage Instructions

#### Method 1: Environment Variable (Recommended - More Secure)
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-openai-api-key-here'
uv run python prompt_evolution.py
```

#### Method 2: Direct in config.yaml (Less Secure - Not Recommended)
Edit `config.yaml`:
```yaml
api_keys:
  openai: "your-openai-api-key-here"
```

### Switching Between Providers

**For Production (OpenAI):**
```yaml
api_provider: "openai"
```

**For Testing (Gemini):**
```yaml
api_provider: "gemini"
```

### Next Steps

1. ✅ OpenAI API key is verified and working
2. ✅ System can complete full evolution cycles
3. ✅ Results are being saved to JSON files
4. ⏳ Consider adding rate limit handling for Gemini
5. ⏳ Build scenario generator to connect Task Definer
6. ⏳ Create domain-specific test scenarios

---

## Summary

The new OpenAI API key is **fully functional** and has been successfully tested with the PromptEvolve system. The key has been stored securely using environment variables, and the system completed a full 3-generation evolution cycle with excellent results (100% success rate, 0.975 quality score).

**Recommendation:** Use OpenAI for production workloads and Gemini for development/testing (with rate limit awareness).
